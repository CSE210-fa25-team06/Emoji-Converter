## Agenda

### Update from each team and to do next

- Back End: Completed the Flask server code assuming valid input. Will explore ML approaches. Can continue working on exploring these ML approaches tomorrow. Simple model with PyTorch. Will explore smaller models as inference time is slow for more complex models.
- Front End: Will meet with Jarred and Siri to look through back end code. 
- Dev Ops: Write basic documentation for the backend code.
- Everyone: No meeting later at 3pm as teams continue to work on connecting front end and back end.
- Team Leads: Work on presentation. Incorporate reflections from team members.
